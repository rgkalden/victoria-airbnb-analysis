# Victoria AirBnb Listings Analysis

In this project, AirBnb listings data is analyzed, with two goals:
1. To better understand the attributes of current listings in the Victoria area
2. Provide insight into the earning potential of an AirBnb host in the Victoria area

## Data Source

AirBnb publishes some of their listings data, which can be found at the following website: [http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/)

The file used in this project is `listings.csv.gz` under the section for Victoria, and is dated September 22, 2022 (the most recent at the time this project was completed). The file is not included in this repo to save space.

Another helpful link that was used for inspiration for this project is AirBnb's own dashboard for the data, located at: [http://insideairbnb.com/victoria/](http://insideairbnb.com/victoria/).

A data dictionary provided by AirBnb is saved in this repo as `Inside Airbnb Data Dictionary.xlsx`.

## Data Analysis

Data Analysis in this project is accomplished using Tableau Public. A dashboard has been created and published to Tableau Public and can be viewed at the following location:

[https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/richard.k6822/viz/VictoriaAirBnbListingsAnalysis/Dashboard1](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/richard.k6822/viz/VictoriaAirBnbListingsAnalysis/Dashboard1)

A Tableau workbook `Victoria AirBnb Listings Analysis.twbx` has also been saved in order to reproduce this work at a later time.

## Results of the Analysis

The following insights have been found using the dashboard:

- A host can potentially earn an estimated $50000/year from a single listing in the Victoria neighbourhood by renting out their 2 bedroom condo for 254 nights per year, at a rate of $211/night. 
- The most in demand units in terms of average nights booked per year are in the neighbourhoods closest to Victoria itself: Victoria, Esquimalt, and Oak Bay for example. Guests of these properties are required by hosts to stay for a minimum of around 10 nights per visit on average, and these properties also are occupied for more of the year, making them more profitable in comparison.
- Single bedroom guest suites are the most common property type in the Victoria area, and come at a price of $129/night.
- Large groups may have to look beyond the immediate Victoria area, as properties capable of accomodating groups larger than 10 are more common in neighbourhoods like the Southern Gulf Islands, Saanich, and Langford.
- Entire home properties are most profitable in the Sooke and Southern Gulf Islands neighbourhoods. In Sooke, a host can potentially earn an estimated $80000/year from renting out their 4 bedroom home for 136 nights per year, at a rate of $615/night. 
- In general, longer minimum nights stayed required by hosts decreases the further the properties get from Victoria. On average the minimum number of nights required by other hosts in the Sooke neighbourhood is 5 nights, less than in Victoria at 12 nights. This raises the question of whether properties are being used for longer or short term rentals.

What does these insights mean for a prospective AirBnb host? They can be used to help a host decide whether it is worth renting out their property. For example, consider these two simple cases:

- If a host owns a property in the Victoria neighbourhood, it may potentially be profitable enough for the owner to rent out their property, however the property would have to be occupied by guests for the majority of the year in order to realize these profits. The property may also end up being a longer term rental, with less frequent guest turnover.

- If a host owns a larger home in Sooke or the Southern Gulf Islands, it may be worth renting out the property for them less frequently, as the typical minimum nights stayed and average nights booked per year are less than in Victoria. This means that the hosts could possibly have their own property available to them more often while still bringing in a significant amount of earnings, as entire home properties in these neighborhoods command higher prices than in Victoria.
