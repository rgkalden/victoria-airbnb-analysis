# Victoria AirBnb Listings Analysis

In this project, AirBnb listings data will be analyzed, with two goals:
1. To better understand the attributes of current listings in the Victoria area
2. Provide insight into the earning potential of an AirBnb host in the Victoria area

## Data Source

AirBnb publishes some of their listings data, which can be found at the following website: [http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/)

The file used in this project is `listings.csv.gz` under the section for Victoria, and is dated September 22, 2022 (the most recent at the time this project was completed). The file is not included in this repo to save space.

Another helpful link that was used for inspiration for this project is AirBnb's own dashboard for the data, located at: [http://insideairbnb.com/victoria/](http://insideairbnb.com/victoria/).

A data dictionary provided by AirBnb is saved in this repo as `Inside Airbnb Data Dictionary.xlsx`.

## Data Analysis

Data Analysis in this project is accomplished using Tableau Public. A dashboard has been created and published to Tableau Public and can be viewed at the following location:

[https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/richard.k6822/viz/VictoriaAirBnbListingsAnalysis/Dashboard1](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/richard.k6822/viz/VictoriaAirBnbListingsAnalysis/Dashboard1)

A Tableau workbook `Victoria AirBnb Listings Analysis.twbx` has also been saved in order to reproduce this work at a later time.

## Results of the Analysis

The following insights have been found using the dashboard:

- A host can potentially earn an estimated $50000/year from a single listing in the Victoria neighbourhood by renting out their 2 bedroom condo for 180 nights per year. 
- The most in demand units in terms of average nights booked per year are in the neighbourhoods closest to Victoria itself: Victoria, Esquimalt, and Oak Bay for example. Guests of these rental units stay around 10 nights per visit, on average.
- Single bedroom guest suites are the most common type of property type in the Victoria area, and come at a price of $129/night.
- Large groups may have to look beyond the immediate Victoria area, as properties capable of accomodating groups larger than 10 are more common in neighbourhoods like the Southern Gulf Islands, Saanich, and Langford.
